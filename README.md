Suggestions for patrick to solve the problem of inputs in the form (,X) or (X,)

1- Convert it into a type, and then see if it matches the expected type?

2- create a list of acceptable inputs and match it to said list, if not found then error.
(2 lists? one for chars one for ints, so you can check individually if expect one and not the other?)
